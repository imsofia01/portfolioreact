        <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-justify">
          I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in UX Designing 
          and Web Development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about 
          bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. 
          User experience, pixel-perfect design, and writing clean, readable, 
          highly performant code matters to me.

          I have started my journey over a year back as a designer and a web 
          developer in 2023, and since then, Iâ€™ve continued to grow and evolve 
          as a designer and a developer, taking on new challenges and learning 
          the latest technologies along the way.

          I'm trying to learn and evolve every day by taking up new challenges 
          and learning new things on a day-to-day basis. I love learning about 
          user psychology and creating a valuable user experience for all types 
          of users.
